# rust-breakout (v 0.1.1)
### About
Our take on the classic game Breakout implemented in rust using [ggez](https://github.com/ggez/ggez).

The player moves a paddle across the bottom of the screen to keep the ball in play. When the ball collides with a brick the brick takes damage until it is broken. If the ball touches the bottom of the screen the player loses a life. The player wins the level by clearing all bricks from the screen.
