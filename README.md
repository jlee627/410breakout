# rust-breakout (v 0.0.1)
### About
Our take on the classic game Breakout implemented in rust using [ggez](https://github.com/ggez/ggez).

The player moves a paddle across the bottom of the screen to keep the ball in play. When the ball collides with a brick it is broken and removed from the screen. If the ball touches the bottom the player loses a life.

The objective of the game is to break all the bricks before running out of lives.
