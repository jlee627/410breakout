# Course Project Write up

### What was built
The course project I worked on was recreating the classic game Breakout
in rust using the ggez crate.

### How it worked
Breakout is a game where the goal is for the player to move a paddle
on the bottom of the screen left and right to bounce a ball to break all the blocks
without letting the ball touch the bottom of the screen.

The ggez crate allowed us to draw and make all assets while also providing all
the tools to we needed to make the game.

### What doesn't work
Sometimes the collision doesn't work exactly as though we wanted it to and can
result in weird bounces, but for the most part the game does exactly what we wanted
it to!

### What lessons were learned
Using the ggez crate was definitely a fun new experience, on top of making an
actual game. It was challenging learning how exactly a game is made and has given
me a lot of insight on the entire process. I really liked how the ggez crate
even gave us the tools to render our own assets without having to draw them
ourselves!
